            Even after passing the driving test, many of us still turn to Google to make sense of the Highway Codes. From drivers wondering if it‚Äôs acceptable to drive in flip-flops to asking if they can drive with a cracked window screen, some road rules remain confusing.   

To uncover the most common sources of confusion, our team at EzLicence analysed UK search data to reveal the top ten most Googled Highway Code questions.

              Finding a driving instructor can be challenging, especially in areas with high demand. If you‚Äôre struggling to find an instructor with availability, consider expanding your search to nearby areas or using online platforms that connect learners with instructors. Additionally, booking lessons during off-peak times may increase your chances of finding an available instructor.

              If you need to cancel a booking with your driving instructor, it‚Äôs important to do so as soon as possible to avoid any cancellation fees. Most instructors require at least 24-48 hours‚Äô notice for cancellations. You can usually cancel by contacting your instructor directly via phone or email, or through the booking platform if you used one to schedule your lessons.
